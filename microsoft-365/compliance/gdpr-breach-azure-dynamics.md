<span data-ttu-id="78eea-p101">Microsoft Azure 十分重視歐盟一般資料保護規範 (GDPR) 所規定的義務。Microsoft Azure 採取了大量的安全性措施，以防範資料外洩的威脅。這包含實體和邏輯兩方面的安全性控制，和自動化的安全性程序、完整的資訊安全與隱私權原則，以及所有人員的安全性與隱私權教育訓練。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="78eea-p101">Microsoft Azure takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seriously. Microsoft Azure takes extensive security measures to protect against data breaches. These include both physical and logical security controls, as well as automated security processes, comprehensive information security and privacy policies, and security and privacy training for all personnel.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="78eea-p102">從一開始 Microsoft Azure 內就已內建各種安全機制，首先是[安全性開發週期](https://www.microsoft.com/sdl/)這項強制性開發程序，結合了「從設計著手保護隱私」和「預設為保護隱私」。Microsoft 安全性策略的最高指導原則是「假設已有缺口」，這是深度防禦策略的延伸。不斷挑戰 Azure 的安全性功能，Microsoft 才能先發制人，對抗接踵而來的新威脅。如需有關 Azure 安全性的詳細資訊，請參閱以下[資源](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/security/azure-security)。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="78eea-p102">Security is built into Microsoft Azure from the ground up, starting with the [Security Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/sdl/), a mandatory development process that incorporates privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default methodologies. The guiding principle of Microsoft's security strategy is to 'assume breach,' which is an extension of the defense-in-depth strategy. By constantly challenging the security capabilities of Azure, Microsoft can stay ahead of emerging threats. For more information on Azure security, please review these [resources](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/security/azure-security).</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="78eea-p103">Microsoft 設有遍布全球的全天候事件回應服務，努力減少針對 Microsoft Azure 的攻擊所造成的影響。Microsoft 在資料中心採用了極為嚴密的作業和程序，以避免未經授權的存取，包括全天候的視訊監控、訓練精良的安全人員、智慧卡和生物特徵辨識控制等，通過多重安全性與合規性稽核 (例如 [ISO/IEC 27018](offering-iso-27018.md)) 的驗證。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="78eea-p103">Microsoft has a global, 24x7 incident response service that works to mitigate the effects of attacks against Microsoft Azure. Attested by multiple security and compliance audits (e.g. [ISO/IEC 27018](offering-iso-27018.md)), Microsoft employs rigorous operations and processes at its data centers to prevent unauthorized access, including 24x7 video monitoring, trained security personnel, smart cards, and biometric controls.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="78eea-p106">Azure 會根據安全性事件回應程序 (也就是 Microsoft Azure 事件管理計劃的子集) 回應潛在的資料外洩。系統會使用以下五個階段程序來實作 Azure 安全性事件回應：偵測、評估、診斷、穩定，及關閉。安全性事件回應小組可能會隨著調查進度輪流進行診斷和穩定。安全性事件回應程序的概觀說明如下：</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="78eea-p106">Azure responds to a potential data breach according to the security incident response process, which is a subset of the Microsoft Azure incident management plan. Azure's security incident response is implemented using a five-stage process: Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, and Close. The Security Incident Response Team may alternate between the diagnose and stabilize stages as the investigation progresses. An overview of the security incident response process is below:</span></span>
